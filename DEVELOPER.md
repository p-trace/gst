# Developers Note
## When to increment which version type
**Major**  
- Config structure changes (new item; removed item; will break)
- Args changes (new; removed; different output)

**Minor**  
- New Feature, which will not affect existing ones
- Very big refacs, that won't break major features

**Patch**  
- Bugfixes without breaking existing features
- Typos in UI

**No Change**  
- Typo in docs
